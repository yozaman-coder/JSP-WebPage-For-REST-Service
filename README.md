- edit connections strings in register, library, and contacts
- ensure all the libraries are imported by maven, see the Day5Starter.jpg
- packages is not impelmented
- I tested contacts and I was able to pull the agencies from the db
- the flash plugin will never work since all browser support is gone.
- don't try and figure out the errors in library, intellij confused with the syntax
